## Expert data - supervised learning

We have a few datasets of professional play in SGF format, not all of which we have permission to share. The "Community" dataset has plenty of high-level games and is free to use (see the dataset's README for information on contributors). We are also experimenting with [GoGoD](http://gogodonline.co.uk/) and [BadukMovies](https://badukmovies.com/pro_games/download). See [here](http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoDatabases) for a compilation of other datasets.

Expert games are saved in the SGF format. The training pipeline begins by batch-processing a collection of SGF files into neural network features. See "phase 0" of the [[neural networks and training]] page.

## Organization

The conversion and training scripts save metadata using relative paths. Using the same structure will make sharing data more easy. Keep the [data repository](https://github.com/Rochester-NRT/AlphaGo.data) on the same level as this repository. When we reference data as `../AlphaGo.data/` it will be consistent across contributors. See that repository for more information on the organization of subdirectories
